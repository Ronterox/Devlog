	<h1>Goals Page</h1>
	<pre>
Here are my current goals, maybe, is just a backlog most probably, even though, all the following goals will eventually be completed,
no matter what, even after I die, or whatever, either because I'm not that creative and somebody does it, or I'll leave it to my robots to do it

I'll try anotate them as I boss that have no idea about it, but really wants it. Like a baby pretty much, that just adds like difficulty and positivism, 
instead of realism? (what every negative person ever said)
