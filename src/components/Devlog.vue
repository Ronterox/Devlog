<h1>Fri 21 Apr 2023</h1>
I believe my expectations on things are to high right now, and I have no idea how to lower them, I made just use google or chatgpt to check how to start lower them,
but my ego wont let it happen.

Okay, I looked it up, and is definitely my expectations are a little bit too high, I don't want them to be low really though, wonder why.

Anyway this is what I did today, after watching a little bit of Dr Uttut, I've decided to go and create this page, not because of the video but because it gave me the motivation 
to do something fun, and dumb, yay

I still don't know if I will upload gifs or webms, but I have 2 options easily need testing still.

This foking web I wanted randomly in a new thing, so I decided, hey let's try Vue, after seeing the option on the vite command, after being for 2 foking hours debbuging how is the typescript server not working, it was just that I needed to update vscode.

Conclusion: Update your stuff, and make sure they are stable new versions only

Okay, so I guess webm doesn't work on vscode neither vue so, GIF it is

</div>


<h2>Starting Vue</h2>

Vue has a pretty cool interactive tutorial so that's what I've been doing,

<img src="../assets/vue-tutorial-interactive.png"/>

After completing, I can see that is pretty easy to understand, also it facilitates fast coding,
without annoying boilerplate

They also have a pretty cool tutorial video set for reacts devs to vue, but for some reason,
you can only watch 2/10 videos free, so yeah..., it was pretty good, for the 2 vids that I watched

Also they are using a weird coding style that is pretty much class components for the tutorial, 

<img src="../assets/vue-class-component.png"/>

but on the vids the use the one that looks like react hooks,

So I guess, they recommend both?

<h2>Discovering new things</h2>

This is why doing new things is fun, I just discovered a pretty cool and useful free api

<img src="../assets/json-placeholder.png"/>

And, literally the best library for any JS Project ever

Also there is this 'pre' tag that you can literally just pass data as it is, and it will stay with the passed formatting

<div class="images">
<img src="../assets/without-pre-tag.png"/>
<img src="../assets/with-pre-tag.png"/>
</div>

<h2>Space Maniac</h2>

My assets on this project are already occupying to much space (2mb), I have to get all these images on imgur,
I add the devlog creator ASAP, so I don't have to code the blog damn pages :)

Cheers
