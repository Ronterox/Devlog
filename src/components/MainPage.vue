Hi there me, or other person
This is my idea of a devlog, to the development of my brain,
I will try to write and upload productive and unproductive things that I do so that my train an AI on my data,
And create another little me, maybe, maybe not

Also I'm doing this so I have the pressure of publishing a part of my life on the internet,
maybe, hopefully, giving me motivation to use my procrastination as a weapon, anyway

I know that once something reaches the internet is completely free and for everybody to see, so
I won't get mad if somebody else that is not me read this, but still weird,

This is mostly for me, but also if somebody finds something benefitial here, good for you buddy!
