Hi there me, or other person
This is my idea of a devlog, to the development of my brain,
I will try to write and upload productive and unproductive things that I do so that my train an AI on my data,
And create another little me, maybe, maybe not

Also I'm doing this so I have the pressure of publishing a part of my life on the internet,
maybe, hopefully, giving me motivation to use my procrastination as a weapon, anyway

I know that once something reaches the internet is completely free and for everybody to see, so
I won't get mad if somebody else that is not me read this, but still weird,

This is mostly for me, but also if somebody finds something benefitial here, good for you buddy!

Goals

Here are my current goals, maybe, is just a backlog most probably, even though, all the following goals will eventually be completed,
no matter what, even after I die, or whatever, either because I'm not that creative and somebody does it, or I'll leave it to my robots to do it

I'll try anotate them as I boss that have no idea about it, but really wants it. Like a baby pretty much, that just adds like difficulty and positivism, instead of realism? (what every negative person ever said)

Money

This is an essential, non-essential part of this, just another extra idea. Is mostly about a message, so I'm kind of quantifying my progress,
like a videogame?, I should probably add another currency, like happiness, or will to live or whatever, just for game-like quantification, like for fun

Today

I believe my expectations on things are to high right now, and I have no idea how to lower them, I made just use google or chatgpt to check how to start lower them,
but my ego wont let it happen.

Okay, I looked it up, and is definitely my expectations are a little bit too high, I don't want them to be low really though, wonder why.

Anyway this is what I did today, after watching a little bit of Dr Uttut, I've decided to go and create this page, not because of the video but because it gave me the motivation 
to do something fun, and dumb, yay

I still don't know if I will upload gifs or webms, but I have 2 options easily need testing still.

This foking web I wanted randomly in a new thing, so I decided, hey let's try Vue, after seeing the option on the vite command, after being for 2 foking hours debbuging how is the typescript server not working, it was just that I needed to update vscode.

Conclusion: Update your stuff, and make sure they are stable new versions only

Okay, so I guess webm doesn't work on vscode neither vue so, GIF it is
